# InstaPost

This package allows you to generate Instagram captions using AI and schedule posts with images and captions to be uploaded at a specified date and time. It includes the following components:

- **`captionGen.py`**: Generates engaging Instagram captions using AI.
- **`instaPost.py`**: Handles Instagram login and photo uploads.
- **`schedulePost.py`**: Combines caption generation and photo upload to schedule posts.

This is a branch of the old python package instabot, specifically the api from this github repo: https://github.com/instagrambot/api.git. 
It used a bunch of other depricated packages and no longer worked on the latest versions of python. I went through condenced it by removing anything I didn't
need for this project, and updated all the dependancies. It now runs on python 3.13, and is focused on logging into instagram and posting.

> **NOTE:** The purpose of this was to get an MVP for a project until we can get the official Instagram API. The way this script works, Instagram will
> eventually detect that your are running a bot and will require a captia challange (which this script cannont handle). Currently I haven't tested much,
> but I have gotten roughly 20-40 logins before it was noticed.

## Notes

- Images work best in JPEG format, however other common forms like png shoud work just fine.
- Instagram *will* detect bot activity and require CAPTCHA challenges after repeated logins. This currently cannot bypass this.
- This package is intended for personal use and testing purposes only.

---

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests Pillow google-genai
```

---


## Future Improvements

- Integrate with the official Instagram Graph API for more reliable and secure functionality.
- Add support for handling CAPTCHA challenges.
- Improve error handling and logging.
